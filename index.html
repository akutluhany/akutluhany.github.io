<B>Summary:</B> <br><br>
Anyshare app will be used by anyone who would like to share a tool/gadget at our platform either
to loan or to rent. Loaners are the users who would like to make money by renting the tools/gadgets they
own. Renters are the users who would like to save money by renting tools/gadgets they need rather than
purchasing. As minimalism is becoming more important in our lives, due to the high cost of living and
high rate of relocation, anyone who does not want to make a permanent commitment to a tool/gadget that
will be used only a few times a year will find our app appealing. Some users will want to be both renters
and loaners at the same time to make money with the tools/gadgets that they already have but they do not
use often, and to save money on the tools/gadgets that they need. Our app will also be attractive to the
renters who would like to try out a product that they have never used before. As our app promotes
utilization efficiency of the existing products and dampens consumerism, people who are concerned about
environmental issues will want to use our app too. The app will also fill a gap as an alternative to online
shopping. When a person is in urgent need of a tool/gadget which is not available in a local store,
ordering online will not be a viable option due to the time limitation. In some other cases, if the tool is too
heavy and the shipping is not covered by the seller, the cost of the online purchase will increase
dramatically. In such cases, Anyshare will look attractive to anyone as it is fast, convenient, and cheap.
